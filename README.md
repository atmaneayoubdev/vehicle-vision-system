**API Request (Python example):**

    import requests
    import base64

    with open("examples/vehicle_001.jpg", "rb") as img_file:
        b64_image = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode()

    payload = {"image": b64_image, "origin": "demo"}

    response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/vehicle-detection", json=payload)
    print(response.json())

**Sample API Response:**

    {
      "detections": [
        {

## Training the Models

This project leverages custom-trained YOLOv8 models for three key computer vision tasks:

- License Plate Detection
- Vehicle Type Classification
- Vehicle Damage Detection

To achieve high accuracy and robustness, the models were trained on carefully curated datasets with precise annotations.

### Dataset Preparation & Labeling

For training, images need to be collected and annotated according to the task:

- **License Plate Detection:** Annotate bounding boxes around vehicle license plates.
- **Vehicle Type Classification:** Label images by vehicle type (e.g., Sedan, SUV, Truck).
- **Vehicle Damage Detection:** Annotate damaged vehicle parts with bounding boxes (e.g., damaged bumper, broken headlight).

**Recommended Tool:** [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) is an excellent platform for dataset management, annotation, and export in YOLO format. You can upload images, label them with bounding boxes, and export datasets ready for YOLOv8 training.

### Example: Dataset Structure (YOLO format)

```
/dataset
/images
/train
img001.jpg
img002.jpg
...
/val
img101.jpg
img102.jpg
...
/labels
/train
img001.txt
img002.txt
...
/val
img101.txt
img102.txt
...
```
**Pro tip:**  
Use annotation tools such as [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to speed up the labeling process and export directly in YOLO format.

If you want to see a full training pipeline example, check out the [Ultralytics YOLOv8 docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).


Each `.txt` label file corresponds to an image and contains object annotations formatted as:  
`<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`,  
where coordinates are normalized (values between 0 and 1) relative to the image dimensions.

### Training Workflow

The models were trained using the [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) framework, which provides an efficient and flexible pipeline.

Basic steps include:

1. **Label your data:** Annotate images using the tools mentioned above.
2. **Organize dataset:** Structure images and labels following the example above, ensuring a split between training and validation sets.
3. **Train the model:** Use commands like the following to start training:

```bash
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=dataset.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
```
