# 🚗 Vehicle Vision System

A production-ready **Computer Vision** system built with **YOLOv8** and **FastAPI**, offering real-time APIs for:

- 🔍 **License Plate Detection**
- 💥 **Vehicle Damage Detection**
- 🚘 **Vehicle Detection**

This project showcases end-to-end deep learning integration — from **training custom models** to **deploying scalable APIs**, making it a powerful example of applying computer vision to real-world automotive use cases.
