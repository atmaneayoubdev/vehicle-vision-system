# üöó Vehicle Vision System

A production-ready **Computer Vision** system built with **YOLOv8** and **FastAPI**, offering real-time APIs for:

- üîç **License Plate Detection**
- üí• **Vehicle Damage Detection**
- üöò **Vehicle Detection**

This project showcases end-to-end deep learning integration ‚Äî from **training custom models** to **deploying scalable APIs**, making it a powerful example of applying computer vision to real-world automotive use cases.
